# Reflect Skill

Use this skill after implementation, bugfixes, or major refactors.

## Team-awareness

Read active team config from `.codex-workflow/config/active-team.json` when present.
Use team paths for where to record follow-up notes, issues, or cross-team responses.

## Procedure

1. Gather context:
   - files modified
   - diff summary
   - tests added/changed
2. Analyze:
   - patterns followed
   - new repeated structures
   - ADR conformance or drift
   - friction points to reduce next time
3. Classify outcomes:
   - New pattern candidate
   - ADR gap candidate
   - No notable deltas
4. Propose concrete next actions:
   - create pattern draft
   - create ADR suggestion
   - update existing pattern

## Output format

- `Patterns followed`
- `New pattern candidates`
- `ADR gaps`
- `Recommended actions`

Keep output direct and actionable.
