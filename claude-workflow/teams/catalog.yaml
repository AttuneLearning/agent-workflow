# Team Role Catalog
# =============================================================================
#
# Generic team role definitions. These are TEMPLATES — they describe what each
# team role does in general, not project-specific details.
#
# Project-specific team configuration (which roles are active, what they own,
# tech stack) lives in dev_communication/teams/ within each project.
