# Dev Communication Process Guide

A complete guide to inter-team communication, issue tracking, and architecture decision management.

---

## Overview

The dev communication system connects three workflows:

```
Issues → Messages → Architecture Suggestions → ADRs
```

**Core principle:** Messages cross team boundaries. Issues stay local. Each team triages its own inbound messages and creates its own issues.

See `.claude-workflow/teams/protocol.yaml` for the universal communication protocol.

## Issue Management

Issues track discrete work items for each team.

### Issue Lifecycle

```
queue/          →        active/         →       completed/
   │                        │                        │
   │ Create                 │ Start work             │ Finish work
   ▼                        ▼                        ▼
┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐           ┌──────────┐
│ Waiting  │    →     │ In Work  │     →     │   Done   │
└──────────┘          └──────────┘           └──────────┘
```

### Creating an Issue

Use `/comms issue` or manually create a file:

**Location:** `{team}/issues/queue/`

**Filename:** `{TEAM}-ISS-{NNN}_{brief_description}.md`

**Template:** `templates/issue-template.md`

**Important:** Only create issues in **your own** team's queue. To request work from another team, send a message to their inbox.

### Moving Issues

| Action | File Move |
|--------|-----------|
| Start work | `queue/` → `active/` |
| Complete | `active/` → `completed/` |

---

## Cross-Team Messaging

Messages enable async communication between teams.

### Message Flow

```
Team A                                    Team B
──────                                    ──────
              {team_b}/inbox/
Sends ──────────────────────────────► Receives + triages

              {team_a}/inbox/
Receives ◄────────────────────────── Sends
```

### When to Send Messages

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Need work from other team | Send request → They triage and create issue |
| Completed cross-team work | Send notification |
| Question about their code/API | Send inquiry |
| Found bug in their code | Send bug report with evidence |
| New or changed API contracts | Send contract proposal |

### Sending a Message

**Location:** `{recipient_team}/inbox/`

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD_{subject_slug}.md`

**Template:** `templates/message-request.md`

### Processing Incoming Messages

When you receive a message:

1. **Request** → Triage and create a local issue if accepted
2. **Bug report** → Verify and create a local issue if confirmed
3. **Response** → Update the related issue
4. **Info** → Acknowledge and archive

Archive processed messages to `archive/`.

## Architecture Decisions

### The Pipeline

```
Trigger           →    Suggestion    →    Review    →    ADR
(work completed)       (draft idea)      (approve)      (formal record)
```

### Creating a Suggestion

Use `/adr suggest [topic]` or manually create in `shared/architecture/suggestions/`.

### Formal ADRs

**Location:** `shared/architecture/decisions/`

**Format:** `ADR-{DOMAIN}-{NNN}-{TITLE}.md`

---

## Issue Lifecycle — 5 Phase Workflow

Every issue follows five mandatory phases. No phase may be skipped.

### Phase 1: Intake

Triage inbound work into actionable issues with contracts and context.

1. **Check comms** — `/comms` to read inbox messages and identify pending requests
2. **Create issues** — Convert accepted inbound messages into local issues (`{team}/issues/queue/`)
3. **Read checklist** — `dev_communication/guidance/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
4. **Define contracts** — If the work involves new or changed API endpoints, define contracts first and send to the other team (`/comms send`). Get agreement before implementation.
5. **Check ADRs** — `/adr` or read `dev_communication/shared/architecture/decisions/` for relevant decisions

Move issue from `queue/` to `active/` when starting work.

### Phase 2: Implementation

Build the feature or fix, with tests, in a verified state.

1. **Implement** — Write the code for the feature or fix
2. **Write tests** — Create unit and/or integration tests for the implementation
3. **Run tests** — `npx jest [path]` to verify tests pass
4. **Verify TypeScript** — `npx tsc --noEmit` must report 0 errors

### Phase 3: QA Gate

Validate the implementation against completion criteria before marking done.

1. **Run completion gate checks:**
   - [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
   - [ ] `npm run test:unit` — all tests pass
   - [ ] New functionality has corresponding tests
2. **Review against code-reviewer-config** — Check `.claude/team-configs/code-reviewer-config.json` criteria

If any check fails, return to Phase 2.

### Phase 4: Completion

Record the work and close the issue.

1. **Create session file** — `memory/sessions/{date}-{issue-slug}.md`
2. **Update issue file** — Add commit hash and set status to COMPLETE
3. **Move issue** — `active/` to `completed/`

### Phase 5: Comms Response

Send a response to the originating team. **This phase is NOT optional.**

If the work was triggered by an inbound message from another team:

1. **Send response** — `/comms send` to the originating team's inbox
2. **Include in the response:**
   - What was fixed or built
   - What changed (endpoints, contracts, behavior)
   - Any action required on their side (e.g., update imports, use new field)
3. **Archive** — Move the original inbound message to `archive/` if not already done
