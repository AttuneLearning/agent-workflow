# Team Configurations

Structured records of team compositions that worked well (or didn't) for specific issue types. Used by Phase 1.5 (Team Selection) to inform preset choices.

## How This Works

1. **Phase 4** writes a `## Team Review` in the session file AND promotes successful configs here
2. **Phase 1.5** reads this directory to find past configs matching the current issue type
3. Over time, this builds a lookup table of "issue type -> best team config"

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `_template.json` | Template for new team config entries |
| `*.json` | Learned team configs (one per significant review) |
